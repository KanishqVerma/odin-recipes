    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Making bakery-worthy chocolate chip cookies is much easier than it seems. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <dl>
        <b><dt>Butter:</dt></b>
        <dd>This classic chocolate chip cookie recipe starts with two sticks of butter creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.</dd>
        <b><dt>Eggs:</dt></b>
        <dd>Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.</dd>
        <b><dt>Vanilla:</dt></b>
        <dd>Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</dd>
        <b><dt>Baking Soda:</dt></b>
        <dd>Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.</dd>
        <b><dt>Water:</dt></b>
        <dd>A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up.</dd>
        <b><dt>Salt:</dt></b>
        <dd>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</dd>
        <b><dt>Flour:</dt></b>
        <dd>All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.</dd>
        <b><dt>Chocolate Chips:</dt></b>
        <dd>Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</dd>
        <b><dt>Nuts (optional):</dt></b>
        <dd>Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</dd>
