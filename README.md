# odin-recipes
This is the first project in TOP cirriculum. 

Project mention forth is a recipe book consisting of 3 random recipes chosen. 
It required basic understanding of HTML code including anchor tags, linking, images, list (both ordered as well as unordered).
Also very important, it emphasizes on regular github staging, commits and writing good commit messages.
Relatively easy, but a good starter project.
